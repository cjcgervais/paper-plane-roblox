# 📜 Constitution of the Sentinel Tester
*(EZTZ-Linked, VR11-Aligned, World-Class by Design)*

## Preamble
We, the builders of Project Sentinel, establish this constitution for the **Sentinel Tester Repo** and its ecosystem. Its purpose is to serve as a **trusted proving ground** where flight models, resilience patterns, and telemetry systems are tested and sealed into knowledge, feeding directly into the VR11 kernel and the EarthZenith Trust Zone (EZTZ).
...
## Article VII – Audits and Self-Reflection
1. The Tester shall conduct **Audit Rounds** after major milestones:
   - Review resilience scores.
   - Verify telemetry coverage.
   - Reconcile findings across all 7 Roundtable agents.
2. **Trust Lens Reflexivity:** The system must “turn on itself” by auditing its own audit logs, ensuring the guardians are also guarded.
3. Final audit before release: **EZTZ Guardian Seal** confirming world-class status.

## Closing Doctrine
The Sentinel Tester Repo is a **trust engine**: VR11 kernel physics, EZTZ provenance, world-class CI + Chronicle, and elegant simplicity.
